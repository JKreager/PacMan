## Instructions
PacMan - Download or clone repository into a folder/directory and run the index.html file in a web browser and then interact with the buttons at the top to begin. 

## Description
A light and small application that creates pacmen on the screen by pushing a button, and then makes them move within the bounds of the screen. 

## Roadmap
- Move the Pacman using the keyboard keys. 
- Turn the other PacMen into ghosts and have 1 actual PacMan logo that eats the others, like the traditional point of the original Pac Man game. 
- Further elaboration on that would involve a point system with the time/duration PacMan survives or the amount of 'tokens/items' collected, once that is implemented.
